# Project overview
Predicting income is a common problem in economics and finance. This project serves as a starting point for understanding how machine learning models, specifically linear regression, can be applied to predict continuous values like income. The model is trained on provided age and experience data and aims to capture the relationship between these factors and income.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pip package manager

# Model Details
The income prediction model employs a simple linear regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library. It calculates the best-fit line based on the provided age and experience data to predict income values. The model is trained using a portion of the dataset and evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and mean squared error.

# Income Prediction Model

A simple machine learning model that predicts income based on age and experience.

## Introduction

The Income Prediction Model is a basic machine learning project aimed at predicting individuals' incomes based on their age and experience. This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praveen9131/salary-prediction.git
   
Install required Python packages:

# bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your data:

Ensure you have a CSV file named income.csv with columns age and experience.
Train the model:

Run the income_prediction.py script to train the model:

# bash
Copy code
python income_prediction.py
Use the interactive interface:

After training the model, an interactive interface will launch. Open the provided URL in your web browser, input age and experience, and get a predicted income.
